Initial random forest machine learning model is actively working, and navigation and basic styling of the web UI is implemented, although integrated functionality of the UI is not.

An extra trees classifier model has been implemented for feature selection.

The following image features are currently implemented as part of the machine learning model:
	* Mean red pixel intensity
	* Mean green pixel intensity
	* Mean blue pixel intensity
	* Number of “brown” pixels in the red band
	* Number of “brown” pixels in the blue band
	* Number of “brown” pixels in the green band
